# Overview (Generation, Utility, Wholesale Market, Retail Market)
**Map**
Generation Assets (Power Plant, Wind Farm, Gas Field) -> 

Portfolio Management (Operative Function, can be same or different unit/company): sells energy and chooses how to operate generation

Portfolio <-> Wholesale Market (Portfolio Management sells or buys energy commodities)

Portfolio -> Retail Market (business, industry customers, final customers)

---
If all of the above is done: Integrated Portfolio.

**Portfolio <-> Wholesale Market = Prop Trading**
- a company trades to make money by buying and selling on wholesale market (no generation or selling for consumption)

**Portfolio <-> Wholesale and -> Retail Market**
- buys on wholesale market and sells on retail market (final consumers: households, industry) (typical for retail energy companies, municipalities, in the area or outside core region, or very large energy consumers(ex. Deutsche Bahn) buying more efficiently for their own needs through their own energy portfolio management team)

**Generation -> Portfolio -> Wholesale Market**
- portfolio management of generation asset decides how to operate generation (optimal production schedule, buying emission allowances, buying fuel ...) and sells on wholesale market
- independent energy producers (windfarms, large solar projects, merchant power plants, gas producers)

**Integrated Portfolio**
- ex large municipalities (generation, wholesale, retail, management), very large industrial consumers (chemical industries, transport), tier 1 energy companies.

# Characteristics of Energy Commodities, Merit Order, Price Formation

## Characteristics of Electricity and Gas as Commodities and Consequences for Market
**Characteristics**
+ grid bound (energy, natural gas pipes for transport)
+ supply = demand in real time to guarantee frequency
+ storing can be costly or difficult
+ seasonality and uncertainty on supply and demand side (demand: ex. household demand falls during the night, higher during the day; usually holds for the economy as a whole; working days; winter peaking and summer peaking companies (depending on country location): heating and AC) (supply: wind and sun for renewable generation): seasonality usually straightforward to predict, uncertainty in unknown (wind is blowing or not, temperature is warm or cold)

**Consequences for market**
- size of market depends on grid usage (**interconnector constraints** define separate markets)
- product is different today and tomorrow (supply and demand determine price and value, storing, uncertainty needs to be accounted for)

## Merit Order

The **merit order** is a key concept in the energy sector, particularly in electricity markets. It refers to the way in which power plants are ranked and dispatched (selected to generate electricity) based on their marginal costs of production. The main idea behind the merit order is to minimize the cost of electricity generation by prioritizing cheaper sources of power.

### How Merit Order Works:
1. **Marginal Cost Ranking**: Power plants are ranked in ascending order according to their **marginal cost**â€”the cost of producing one additional unit of electricity. Marginal costs are primarily driven by fuel prices, operational efficiency, and emissions costs. 
   - **Renewable energy** (wind, solar) typically has very low marginal costs, since wind and sunlight are free.
   - **Nuclear power** has relatively low marginal costs, followed by **coal** and **natural gas** plants.
   - Older and less efficient fossil fuel plants tend to have higher marginal costs.

2. **Supply and Demand**: Electricity demand fluctuates throughout the day, so system operators dispatch electricity from plants in the order of the merit ranking. Power plants with the lowest marginal cost are used first, and as demand increases, more expensive plants are brought online to meet the demand.

3. **Market Clearing Price**: The price of electricity in the market is typically set by the last (most expensive) power plant needed to meet demand at a given time. This plant is referred to as the "marginal plant" and its cost determines the **market clearing price** for all electricity generated.

### Example of Merit Order:
- At low demand, power is supplied by low-cost renewable energy sources like wind and solar.
- As demand rises (e.g., during peak hours), additional capacity is needed, so more expensive natural gas or coal plants are brought online.
- The last and most expensive plant required to meet demand sets the electricity price for the entire market.

### Importance in Energy Markets:
- **Efficiency**: Merit order ensures that electricity is generated at the lowest possible cost by using the cheapest resources first.
- **Price Dynamics**: Since renewable energy has low marginal costs, their increased integration into the grid pushes expensive fossil fuel plants further up the merit order, potentially lowering overall electricity prices.
- **Impact on Profitability**: Power plants lower in the merit order (like renewables) have an advantage in being dispatched more frequently, while more expensive plants may only be dispatched during periods of high demand.
- **Environmental Benefits**: As the share of low-cost, low-carbon renewable energy grows, it can reduce reliance on fossil fuels and lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions.

In summary, the merit order helps optimize electricity generation, keeping costs down and influencing market prices while also supporting the integration of renewable energy sources.

## Price Formation of Energy Commodities
- supply and demand on exchange: markets intersecting supply and demand find the equilibrium price.
