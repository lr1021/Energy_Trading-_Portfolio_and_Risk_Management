# BTU - Energy Trading, Portfolio and Risk Management

I have recently followed an online lecture course provided by Brandenburgische Technische Universit√§t (BTU) on Energy Trading, Portfolio and Risk Management and I enjoyed discovering how something as complex and vital as the energy system works.

I have compiled my set of notes for the course in markdown format. These and a pdf rendering of the whole set of notes is available in this repository.

Please have a read and let me know if you spot any mistakes or have questions on the material!
